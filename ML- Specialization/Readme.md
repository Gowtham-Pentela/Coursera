### Installation
1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`

2. **Setup**:
   Install the necessary packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
   ```

### Project Structure
The script is organized as follows:
- **Packages**: Imports necessary libraries.
- **Problem Statement**: Introduces the problem of predicting profits for a restaurant.
- **Dataset**: Details the dataset used (likely contains variables like population and profit).
- **Compute Cost**: Calculates the cost function for linear regression.
- **Gradient Descent**: Iteratively updates model parameters to minimize the cost function.

### Usage
1. Open and run the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python C1_W2_Linear_Regression.py
   ```
2. Follow the guided sections to understand the implementation steps for linear regression, from computing the cost function to running gradient descent.

### Exercises
The script includes interactive exercises designed to reinforce each concept:
- **Exercise 1**: Compute the cost function.
- **Exercise 2**: Implement gradient descent for optimizing parameters.
